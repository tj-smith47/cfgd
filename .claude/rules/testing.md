# cfgd Testing

- `cargo test` must pass before any phase is considered complete.
- Unit tests for pure logic (config parsing, diffing, template rendering). Co-located in `#[cfg(test)] mod tests {}` within each module.
- Integration tests in `tests/`, using `assert_cmd` for CLI commands.
- Package manager tests use mock trait implementations, not real system calls.
- Use `tempfile` for any test that touches the filesystem.
